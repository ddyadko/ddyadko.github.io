                   <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>Who are you?</h3>
    <p>My name is Danile Dyadko. And this picture is me: <img src="Me.jfif" alt="A description of the image" width="100" height="100" title="Me"> </p>
                
    <h3>What is your justification to disclose personal details?</h3>
    <p> I truly believe having "skin in the game" (reducing anonymity) in regard to online discussions will increase the human aspect.</p>

    <h3>Why does this website look and feel bare-bone</h3>
    <p>I do not want to distract people from the message(s) I want to convey by implementing arbitraire cosmetics. Besides I truly believe we are over-stimulated in the Western world which is the cause of many psychological stressors we experience. Less stimulation feels more freeing. Expect a full blogpost about my ideas about this in the near future. Besides: it reduces maintainance, improves security and is mobile-responsive</p>
    
    <h3>Why did you make this website?</h3>
    <p>It started out with not being able to post my thoughts on LinkedIn due to characther limitations. This moved me to screenshotting my thoughts from a Word Processor and posting it. This made me realise that perhaps creatign a personal blog would be a better solution. Only time will tell.</p>
